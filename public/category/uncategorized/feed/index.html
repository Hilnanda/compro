<p><strong>Tom Rhoton</strong> is the vice president of marketing at Zenger Folkman. He and his team are responsible for communication, messaging, lead acquisition, and press relations. With over twenty-five years of experience in field, channel, partner and product marketing, Tom has come to the conclusion that organizations require two things from their marketing teams: Data and Inspiration. Metrics are essential to making complex value-based marketing decisions for any company. But equally important is the ability to motivate those around you and to multiply their talents.</p>
<p>Tomâ€™s experience comes from working with global companies in many different industries. As a marketer, he has the unique perspective that only comes from someone who has held multiple sales and sales management positions and understands what is required to achieve quota.</p>
<p>Prior to Zenger Folkman, Tom was Vice President of Marketing at EveryoneSocial, and Vice President of Global Direct and Marketing Operations at Symantec.</p>
<p>Tom holds a Bachelor of Science degree in Information Management from Brigham Young University, and an MBA from the University of Utah. His approach â€“ data and inspiration â€“ runs parallel to Zenger Folkmanâ€™s mission to help good managers become extraordinary.</p>
